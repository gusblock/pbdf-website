                    <h2>Digital signatures with IRMA: some <em>sign-by-QR</em>
                    examples</h2>
                    <p>
		      On this page you can try out some examples in
		      which you can produce digital signatures
		      yourself, with the attributes in your IRMA
		      app. After pressing the buttons below, a signing
		      request appears in your IRMA app. When you read
		      this page on your phone, the switch to the IRMA
		      app is made automatically. When you read this
		      page on another device, you should first scan
		      the the QR code that appears, using the IRMA app
		      on your phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
		      None of these example leads to actual
		      obligations. You can safely perform these
		      signing acts. The example text that you sign
		      does not commit you and the resulting signature
		      is not stored.
                    </p>
                    <p>
		      In order to be able to try out these examples
		      you must have collected the relevant attributes
		      in your IRMA app. This can be done via the
		      IRMA <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/">issuance
		      page</a>.

                          <p>
			    Here you are asked to give GDPR-style
			    consent so that advertisements can be sent
			    to you. The attribute with which you sign
			    this consent message is the email address
			    at which you agree to receive the
			    advertisements. No further attributes of
			    yours are disclosed via this signature. In
			    principle, more of your attributes could
			    be included (like your gender, date of
			    birth, etc) so that advertisements are
			    more targeted.
                          </p>
                          <p>
			    Giving permission via a digital signature
			    is the perfect way to register consent
			    under the General Data Protection
			    Regulation (GDPR). This consent in the
			    form of a digital signature can be
			    transferred to other (partner)companies,
			    giving them certainty, because they can
			    check the signature themselves. Also,
			    these signatures can be shown to the
			    GDPR-regulator, upon request, in order to
			    demonstrate that consent has actually been
			    given by the owner of the email address.
                          </p>

			    Here you are asked to sign as teacher that

			    you work, and your email address at that
			    institution.

		      Attribute-based digital signatures offer many
		      new possibilities: a police officer, for
		      instance, can sign a report with his/her name
		      and police-registration number, as IRMA
		      attributes; in this way the integrity and
		      authenticity of this report is guaranteed in the
		      whole criminal justice chain. Also, a medical
		      doctor can sign a medical statement with his/her
		      own medical credentials as IRMA attributes, so
		      that everyone can verify that this statement is
		      actually signed by a medical doctor (and also by
		      whom). Within organisations all kinds of
		      decisions can be registered reliably and
		      verifiably with digital signatures. IRMA is the
		      only identity platform that seamlessly combines
		      both authentication and signing.
