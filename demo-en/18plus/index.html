<h1>Demo: age verification with IRMA</h1>

<div id="result_status"></div>

<p>
This page contains an example of a simple age check with IRMA,
together with an explanation of how this works and can be used, for
instance by webshops or video sites. With the button below it can be
checked whether a visitor of such a site is indeed older than
18. What's special about IRMA is its privacy-friendliness: the visitor
reveals no other information than the fact that (s)he is 18+. For this
property "older than 18" there is a special IRMA attribute; only the
yes/no information in that attribute is revealed to the requesting
webpage.
</p>

<p>
In order to be able to try out yourself the button below you need to
have the IRMA
app <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/download-en/">installed</a>
with at least the <b>older than 18</b> attribute loaded.  This can be
done
via <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/idin/">iDIN
issuance webpage</a> of the Privacy by Design foundation. A succesful
check that the visitor is older than 18 gives subsequent access to
material that is only suitable for an 18+ audience.
</p>

<center style="margin: 2em">
    <button class="btn btn-primary" id="try_irma_18btn">Older than 18 check</button>
</center>

<p>
A few remarks:
<ul>
<li> A similar button can be used for other age checks, like "older
than 12", "older than 16", or even "older than 65". These attributes
can be collected in principle by anyone with a Dutch bank account,
via <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/issuance/idin/">iDIN</a>.
The software for checking these attributes, as used here, is open
source, freely available, and can be used without costs, see also
the <a href="https://privacybydesign.foundation/irma-verifier/">webpage</a>
of the foundation with more information on this.

<li> Buttons like the above one are especially relevant for webshops
that have a legal obligation to perform age verification when offering
violent or possibly offensive games or films, or by gambling
sites. The button could also be used to regulate online access to
catch up TV programs. Currently, many of these sites do not have
proper age checks because there is no user-friendly (and cheap)
technology available. With IRMA this excuse can no longer be used.

<li> With IRMA it is possible to verify not only "older than" but also
"younger than" attributes, such as "younger than 16" or "younger than
12". Such attributes can be used to restrict access to certain
webpages or chat sites to minors --- and to exclude others, in
principle. So far, these "younger than" attribute are not issued by
the foundation, on the one side because no specific application has
emerged, and on the other side because it is unclear from which age
onwards one can reasonably expect children to use the IRMA app.
</ul>
